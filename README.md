Hereâ€™s a concise, structured summary of your edtech app idea designed for clarity and interoperability with AI agents:

---

### **App Overview**
**Name**: PeerCampus  
**Objective**: A peer-to-peer learning platform where high-achieving students ("scholars") monetize their expertise by tutoring peers within their college/university. Promotes community-driven education and reduces dependency on institutional resources.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **College-Centric Access**:
   - Users authenticate via college email (e.g., `@collegeA.edu`), restricting access to peers from the same institution.
   - Domain verification ensures trust and relevance (e.g., only `collegeA.edu` users see `collegeA` content).

2. **Scholar Features**:
   - Schedule live/recorded lectures on specific topics.
   - Set custom pricing per lecture (e.g., â‚¹50â€“â‚¹500).
   - Promote lectures via WhatsApp groups or app notifications.

3. **Student Features**:
   - Browse and purchase lecture passes.
   - Attend live sessions (via Jitsi Meet integration) or access recordings.
   - Rate/review lectures for quality control.

4. **Payment System**:
   - Students pay per lecture (price set by scholar + â‚¹1 platform fee).
   - Daily settlements (midnight) to scholars via Razorpay/Stripe.
   - No commissionâ€”revenue relies solely on platform fees.

5. **Community Building**:
   - College-specific dashboards, forums, and leaderboards.
   - Study groups and peer Q&A boards.

---

### **User Roles**
1. **Scholar**:
   - Profile: Verified via CGPA/college credentials.
   - Actions: Schedule lectures, set prices, host sessions, track earnings.

2. **Student**:
   - Profile: Basic college email authentication.
   - Actions: Purchase passes, attend lectures, rate tutors.

3. **Admin**:
   - Oversight: Moderate content, resolve disputes, manage payments.

---

### **Workflows**
1. **Authentication**:  
   `User Signup â†’ College Email Verification â†’ Access College-Specific Content`.

2. **Lecture Lifecycle**:  
   `Scholar Schedules Lecture â†’ Students Purchase Pass â†’ Live Session/Recording â†’ Post-Lecture Review`.

3. **Payment Flow**:  
   `Student Pays (Scholar Price + â‚¹1 Fee) â†’ Daily Settlement to Scholarâ€™s Bank Account`.

---

### **Monetization**
- **Revenue Model**: â‚¹1 platform fee per lecture purchase (no commission).  
- **Future**: Premium features (analytics for scholars, certifications).

---

### **Scalability Plan**
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Launch in 1â€“2 colleges.  
2. **Phase 2**: Expand to affiliated universities.  

---

### **Unique Value Proposition (UVP)**
- **Trust**: College-restricted access ensures safety and relevance.  
- **Affordability**: Low-cost learning vs. traditional edtech platforms.  
- **Empowerment**: Scholars earn money; learners access hyper-local expertise.
